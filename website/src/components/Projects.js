I identified and reported a critical TCP data-loss bug at high payload sizes, resulting in a confirmed fix. Additionally, I authored comprehensive benchmarking reports with detailed analysis and protocol optimization recommendations. I dedicate 10 hours per week to the project, including participating in weekly stand-up meetings to track progress and set goals."/>

It was developed using Node.js and React Native. Xcode and Expo were used to simulate the app during development, and Google Firebase was used via API integration for backend management of data. At the end of devlopment, the project was presented at a project showcase, where a Tech@NYU cohort lead ranked it as the best Fall 2024 Project."/>
            <ProjectCard name="Music Tinder" photoUrl={MusicTinder}  demoLink = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzFGb4SRqw0' description="Music Tinder is a Spotify-integrated application that gamifies music discovery by allowing users to swipe through their liked songs organized by genre, similar to the Tinder dating app interface. Users can select genres from their music library, then swipe left to skip or right to save songs they enjoy, with the interface dynamically adapting its color scheme to match each track's album artwork. The application features audio streaming capabilities through YouTube for song previews and leverages the Spotify API to fetch user libraries and create custom playlists. After swiping through songs, users can automatically generate a new Spotify playlist containing all their right-swiped tracks, making it an engaging tool for rediscovering forgotten favorites and creating curated playlists."/>
